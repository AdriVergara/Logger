# Logger
Xamarin Forms Logger. Creates a Log file Independently of the platform running

Xamarin Forms Logger. This program creates a Log file independently of the platform running. By default, also checks if the log file is
 older than 5 days (can be modified) and cleans its content if true. 

The PATHS where the log file is saved, depending on the OS are:

· Windows: “C:\Users\ UserName \AppData\Local\Packages\7ca201f1-c462-4618-84d0-007ec7998888_qw3nf19x2fc3g\LocalState\Logger\logTest.log”

· Android: “/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.companyname.LoggerTest/files/._override_/logTest.log”

· iOS: “/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/7E3369E5-EC9D-4870-96E4-137E0F11CD66/Documents/logTest.log”
